                            <br>
                            <p>As soon as the work to turn the Place Bellecour into a royal square was completed, the Lyon 
                                Consulate acquired the land on the Ile Mognat. </p>

                            <p>It was separated from the city by the confluence of the Rhône and the Saône, which at the time was 
                            surrounded by the ramparts of the Ainay Abbey. Entirely folded in on the Saône, encumbered by the numerous carts and 
                            occupied by religious buildings or enclosures, the 18th century town suffered from the extreme smallness of its territory, which 
                            contrasted since the Renaissance with the international amplitude of its exchanges. </p>

                            <p>The engineer Michel-Antoine Perrache launched a plan to drain and fill in the lônes (arms of a river) in order to join the string 
                            of islands and extend the city to the south, beyond the Ainay ramparts. This project, presented in 1766 and then in 1769, approved by letters
                            patent from King Louis XV, made it possible to conquer two kilometres of territory on the confluence. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>It took seven decades (1841) to complete this titanic project. </p>
                            <p>
                                At the same time, Jean-Antoine Morand advocated an extension to the left bank of the Rhône - a bank that had been hostile and alien until then - and the 
                                creation of the new Brotteaux district at the outlet of a second bridge over the Rhône north of the Guillotière bridge. But only the construction of this bridge 
                                (in the 1770s) will immortalise his ambition. </p>

                            <p>As early as 1816, the construction of a prison was envisaged on the Perrache peninsula.</p>

                            <p>Louis-Pierre Baltard, architect, painter and engraver, builder of the Lyon courthouse, was entrusted with the project. In 1831, the prisoners were 
                            transferred to the new Saint-Joseph prison, which was still unfinished. Having become one of the most unhealthy prisons in France, it was transferred to Corbas. </p>

                            <p>The origins of the Compagnie du gaz de Lyon date back to 1833 with the Perrache peninsula as the operating area and the construction of the Perrache gas plant.</p>
                            <p>In 1836, the gas plant became the Société anonyme d'éclairage par le gaz hydrogène pour la ville de Lyon, better known as Gaz de Perrache. Finally, in 1870, it became the Société anonyme du gaz pour la ville de Lyon. The site expanded southwards from 1874 to 1876.</p>

                            <p>The district offered facilities for the supply of animals, as at the time they came by boat, on foot or in carts that crossed the city. The Rhone River allowed for the evacuation of waste and provided abundant water for cleaning the premises. The establishment was transferred to Gerland in the 1920s. Demolished in 1933, low-cost housing (HBM) was built there (cf 1913).

                            <p>As early as 1824, the authorities sought to move the arsenal, which was then located on the Saône near Ainay. </p>
                            <p>The work was completed in 1848, and the artillery department moved to Perrache, specialising in the production of shells. After the Second World War, it became a study establishment for the manufacture of projectiles. Damaged by fire in 1980, it was demolished in 1983 to make way for the current regional gendarmerie.</p>

 Built on a 6-metre-high embankment by François-Alexis Cendrier, who was also the architect of the Gare de Lyon in Paris, it forms a rampart between the north and south on the Cours de Verdun.

                            <p> This elevation is nevertheless pierced by vaults, hence the name "behind the vaults" attributed to the south of the peninsula. The railway station and the railroad contributed to the development of the district. Industrial activities flourished - 37 factories were listed - and the working-class population settled nearby, in the present-day Sainte-Blandine district.

                            <P> In 1860, Antoine Louvier was responsible for the construction of the new Saint-Paul prison. Its design was quite different and based on a more functional approach to prison space. Having become one of the unhealthiest prisons in France, it was transferred to Corbas.</p>

                            <p> The Habitations à Bon Marché (HBM) housing estate in rue Quivogne was the first to be built in Lyon. The architect A. Schaeffer was chosen for his project entitled "Where air and light penetrate, disease never enters". Construction took place from 1913 to 1914, then in 1930. Today, the complex consists of 160 dwellings.</p>
                            <p> Following this first initiative, the city launched a major campaign to build low-cost housing, including the Ravat group and the Perrache housing estate. The architectural firm Lambert et fils directed the work on the Ravat complex, which was built between 1924 and 1932. Located next to the Quivogne group, it reinforces the predominantly working-class aspect of the housing in the south of the Presqu'île. It comprises 57 dwellings divided between the three buildings on Rue Ravat and two independent modules on Rue Quivogne and Rue Delandine.</p>

                            <p> The Port Rambaud was built late, in the 1920s, although the idea of a port was already unanimously supported in the 19th century.  </p>
                            <p> From 1920 onwards, the provisional port, built and equipped during the war for national defence, was opened to trade. On 12 June 1926, Port Rambaud was inaugurated, and the concession was given to the Lyon Chamber of Commerce. In 1932, it was completed by an oil port, which was burnt down on 18 June 1940. The activity of the port will cease in 1995. Today the port has become the Docks, dedicated to art, culture and communication</p>

                            <p> Until 1961, the market and station were located on the banks of the Saône. As early as 1923, the municipality wanted to move it to free up the city centre. </p>
                            <p>municipality wanted to move it to free up the city centre.
 Due to a lack of funds, the definitive move was only adopted in 1955. Inaugurated on 9 May 1961, the market station covers an area of 24 hectares. It was moved to Corbas in 2008.
 </p>
                            <p> Today, the land occupied by the former wholesale market is seeing the development of the second phase of the project

                            <p>By 2025, the interchange will be renovated and converted by a private operator. A comfortable public passageway will facilitate passenger access to Perrache station from Place Carnot</p>
